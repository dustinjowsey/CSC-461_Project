						                    **Multimedia Systems In Automobiles**
  A form of multimedia systems that are becoming more and more advanced are ones found in vehicles. Many newer versions of these systems allow you to watch movies, play music, see from cameras on the car, and control functions of the vehicle all from these systems. For my project idea I would like to look into how these systems communicate with each other and the vehicle. I would like to research the protocols used in these systems and how certain protocols work better for specific tasks. I would also like to investigate the systems used for automatic parking, or self driving features of newer vehicles. There have also been some interesting developments with augmented reality in vehicles which I would also like to research. 

**Problem:**
	The problem these systems are attempting to solve, is to allow a safer more efficient method of transportation, or to improve the driving experience. These are important issues to consider because driving is a big part of many peoples daily lives, and also causes many deaths each year.

**What has been done:**
	The introduction of autonomous vehicles could allow a much safer and more efficient method of travelling assuming everyone had a vehicle that could drive autonomously. Furthermore, to improve the driving experience vehicles are being sold with tablets that connect with your phone and the vehicle. These system definitely offer many distractions to drivers, but improve the driving experience through ease of use and access to vehicle functions.
Deliverabilities and schedule:
	The first thing I would like to look into are the different protocols these multimedia systems are using to communicate and transfer data with the vehicle, cameras, as well as your phone or key fob, and you as the driver. I would like to accomplish this by the middle of October around the 21st. 
	Next I would like to research how autonomous driving utilizes the data from cameras, and other information from the vehicle to work properly. This will include how these systems go about compressing data, as well as combining data from different sensors. I would like to accomplish most of this by November 6th when the project update is due.
	Lastly I would like to research the ideas for augmented reality while driving, and how these systems utilize information differently from the autonomous driving system. Furthermore, I would like to determine the ideas for this technology and where it could be heading in the future considering this technology requires you to be driving the vehicle, but we are already seeing autonomous vehicles becoming a reality. This will be my last idea of research and thus will be finished by December 4th.
