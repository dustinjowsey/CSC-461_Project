**File Converter**
Image and Video File Type Conversion

**Whatâ€™s the problem?**    
The issue of having numerous file types is that some applications may require you to use specific
file types in their software. It is important to have methods to convert between file types to allow
people to use software easier.

**What has been done?**    
Current file conversion options tend to cost money, or are posted on insecure websites. You can
not always be too sure what you are downloading when installing the converted file.

**Approach to the project**    
My approach to this project is to begin with researching common photo file types. After doing this I
will begin implementing a file conversion program for decoding and encoding these common photo file
types. After this I will research audio file formats and implement encoding and decoding algorithms for
these types of files as well. If time permits I would like to attempt video file conversion as well as file
compression such as .zip.

**Delivery**    
I plan to deliver this on my GitHub page and use command line to run the program. By October 23rd
(our update date) I want to have finished the photo conversion part of the program. After this I want to
have implemented the audio conversion aspect by November 6th. Then I would like to continue
researching video file types and have this implemented by the December 4th. If I can get ahead of
schedule I would like to look into .zip file types and maybe create a UI as well.
